# week-4-lesson-plan

Reflection: This lesson successfully gave them a deeper understanding of functions. We spent sufficient time on while loops, and then putting it all together with the encryption was definitely a good idea. However, they didn't have a lot of time to edit code at the end, which would have helped with making their understanding more concrete. Overall, it was a good lesson for giving them a deeper understanding of functions and introducing them to while loops. Just like last week 7.5-8/10
